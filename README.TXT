                 (small DOS game, written by Mihajlov Ilija)

Introduction

   This is a classic snake game I made in 2012. It is written in
   Borland Turbo Pascal 6.0. The game is for DOS and works with a 320x200
   (256 color palette) screen mode. SNAKE.EXE file takes 38 kb of memory.


Gameplay

   The snake's goal is to pick up as much as possible food and to avoid
   hitting the walls or its own tail.  Each time the snake eats a piece of
   food, its tail grows longer.
